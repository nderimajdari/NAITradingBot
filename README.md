NAITradingBot

NAITradingBot is an automated cryptocurrency trading agent designed to interact with the Binance API and execute trades based on advanced machine learning strategies, including LSTM with attention mechanisms and multiple technical indicators (RSI, MACD, EMA, SMA, breakout/breakdown logic).

The bot has been tested in both Testnet and Mainnet environments and supports real-time execution with live market data through Binance WebSocket streams.

🚀 Features

✅ Binance API Integration – Secure connection with Binance Testnet & Mainnet.

✅ Automated Trading – Executes buy/sell orders based on AI-driven signals.

✅ Multi-Strategy Support – Uses indicators such as RSI, EMA, SMA, MACD, and breakout strategies.

✅ Deep Learning Model – LSTM + Attention mechanism for predictive decision-making.

✅ Scalping / HFT Mode – Capable of executing multiple trades per minute with small profit margins.

✅ Risk Management – Custom stop-loss, dynamic position sizing (in progress).

✅ Logging & Analytics – Trade logs, balance tracking, and performance evaluation.

🛠️ Installation
Requirements

Python 3.9+

Binance API

Required libraries:

pip install python-binance pandas numpy tensorflow deap matplotlib

⚙️ Configuration

Create a new API Key & Secret from Binance API Management.

Enable Spot & Margin Trading.

Do NOT enable withdrawals.

(Optional) Restrict API keys to your server IP for extra security.

Add your keys in a .env file:

API_KEY=your_api_key_here

Select environment:

# For Testnet
client = Client(API_KEY, API_SECRET, testnet=True)

# For Mainnet
client = Client(API_KEY, API_SECRET)

▶️ Usage

Run the bot with:

python main.py
